              The motivation behind starting ERIP was to reduce the harmful
              e-waste footprint on the planet. E-waste is produced in heaps in
              the IT sector, and ERIP is on a mission to diminish this footprint
              drastically. The idea behind ERIP is to spread e-waste awareness
              among the tech-savvy generation and introduce them to a company
              where device repair is made simple with a few clicks. Our motto
              lies in the address the concern of E-Waste by using 3Râ€™s- Reuse.
              Repair. Recycle.
